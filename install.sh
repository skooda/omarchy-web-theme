#!/bin/bash
# Wire up the Omarchy Web Theme extension for the current user: the omarchy
# theme-set hook, the browser --load-extension flag, and — outside a packaged
# install — the native-messaging host manifests.
#
# Usage:
#   ./install.sh [--no-flags] [--uninstall]
#
#   --no-flags   Skip editing ~/.config/<browser>-flags.conf. Use this if you'd
#                rather load the extension by hand via Developer mode.
#   --uninstall  Reverse everything this script installs.
#
# No extension ID argument: extension/manifest.json pins the ID with a "key",
# so it's the same on every machine and is baked into the host manifest.
#
# This same script ships twice: as ./install.sh in a git checkout, and as
# /usr/bin/omarchy-web-theme-setup in the AUR package. It figures out which it
# is from its own path, so there's only ever one copy of this logic to maintain.
